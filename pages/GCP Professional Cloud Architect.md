- Resource Hierarchy
  id:: 638b7b14-0709-448c-a97f-0ba4a44e5b5d
	- Permissions to resources inherit permissions similar to the structure of [[Azure AD]]
	- everything below the [[GCP Domain]] is considered a resource
	- Service-Level Resources
		- Compute Instances
		- [[GCP Cloud Storage]] buckets
		- [[GCP Cloud SQL]] databases
	- Account-level Resources
		- [[GCP Organization]]
		- [[GCP Folder]]
		- [[GCP Project]]
	- Above the [[GCP Organization]] is the [[GCP Domain]] (cloud level)
	- ![image](https://cloud.google.com/static/resource-manager/img/cloud-hierarchy.svg)
	- Resources are organized with a parent-child relationship
	- policies are controlled by [[GCP IAM]]
	- access control policies and configuration settings on a parent resource are inherited by the child
	- #+BEGIN_TIP
	  EACH CHILD RESOURCE CAN ONLY HAVE ONE PARENT
	  #+END_TIP
	- like [[Azure]], tags can be added to any resource or logical structure in GCP
	- mirror your resource hierarchy to your organization structure
