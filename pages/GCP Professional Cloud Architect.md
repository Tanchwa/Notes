	- [[GCP Multi Region]]
-
- Compute Services
	- [[GCP Compute Engine]] (GCP VMs)
		- manage multiple instances with [[GCP Managed Instance Group]]
		- add or remove capacity using autoscaling
	- GCP also offers [[GCP Live Migration]] for VM instances
		- for regular maintenance, it moves the complete instance to a different zone
		- can do this manually, but GCP does this
		- GPU attached instances cannot use this feature

		- block storage - persistent disk
			- fastest available
			- files are split into evenly sized blocks of data with unique IDs
			- given to OS as raw data
			- OS structures it with a file system
			- mountable, bootable
		- file storage
			- Network File system
			- directory tree structure
			- Mountable (not bootable)
		- Object storage - cloud storage
			- unstructured
			- doesn't matter where it is
			- can use an open source tool to mount it called [[Fuse]]
			- but otherwise is unmountable and un-bootable
		- Performance terms
			- IO

- Resource Hierarchy
  id:: 638b7b14-0709-448c-a97f-0ba4a44e5b5d
	- Permissions to resources inherit permissions similar to the structure of [[Azure AD]]
	- everything below the [[GCP Domain]] is considered a resource
	- Service-Level Resources
		- Compute Instances
		- [[GCP Cloud Storage]] buckets
		- [[GCP Cloud SQL]] databases
	- Account-level Resources
		- [[GCP Organization]]
		- [[GCP Folder]]
		- [[GCP Project]]
	- Above the [[GCP Organization]] is the [[GCP Domain]] (cloud level)
	- ![image](https://cloud.google.com/static/resource-manager/img/cloud-hierarchy.svg)
	- Resources are organized with a parent-child relationship
	- policies are controlled by [[GCP IAM]]
	- access control policies and configuration settings on a parent resource are inherited by the child
	- #+BEGIN_TIP
	  EACH CHILD RESOURCE CAN ONLY HAVE ONE PARENT
	  #+END_TIP
	- like [[Azure]], tags can be added to any resource or logical structure in GCP
	- mirror your resource hierarchy to your organization structure
-

		- *also needs an availability mindset*
		- least privilage
		- defence in depth
		- fail securely
		- and more in [OWASPs Security by Design Principles](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Security_by_Design_Principles)
- To manage identity (AuthN)
	- [[G Suite Domain]], [[GCP Cloud Identity]]
	- [[GCP Service Account]]
	- identity hierarchy with [[Google Groups]]
	- [[GCDS]]
- For authorization (AuthZ)
	- [[Google Groups]]
	- resource hierarchy [[GCP Organization]], [[GCP Folder]], [[GCP Project]]
	- and [[GCP IAM]]
	- consider Billing management as well
- for accounting
	- audit/ activity logs in [[GCP Cloud Monitoring]]
	- [[GCP Billing Export]]
		- to [[GCP BigQuery]]
		- [[GCP Cloud Storage]] bucket

	- [[GCP Cloud Pub/Sub]]
	- [[GCP Composer]]
	- [[GCP Genomics]]
	- [[GCP Cloud Datalab]]
	- [[GCP Cloud Dataprep]]
	- important to identify and control data flows, not just memorize
	- what is a data flow
		- Moving data - network
		- Processing data - compute
		- Remembering data - storage
		- and all the messy gooey combinations between them
	- build mental models
	- identify and think through data flows
	- #+BEGIN_TIP
	  requirements and options aren't always clear, especially in the real world
	  #+END_TIP
	- In data flows, they aren't always from point a to point b
		- input is large and disparate like rainfall
		- lots of aggregation like rivers
		- lots of destinations and separation

	- can also use these tools with [[AWS]]
-
- Zooming in and out
	- start at the big picture
	- only get more granular when it helps you solve the problem
		- you don't need to know how packet headers are constructed to host a video streaming website
