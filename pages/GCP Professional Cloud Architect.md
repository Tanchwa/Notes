- Scenario set up
	- Reliable stable connection between stores
		- current VPN is slow and has too much bandwidth eaten up by database replication
	- Fast and Cost Effective cloud backup
	- Deploy into new regions quickly when required
		- bowtie inc is a multinational company looking to expand
	- base infra is scalable and low cost
	- automated

	- On demand self service
	- Broad network access
	- Resource pooling
	- Rapid Elasticity
	- Measured Service

- Regions and Geographies
	- 24 [[Region]]s
	- 73 ((638a41a2-9491-4f0a-95ef-492279f64cbd))
	- uses [[GCP Edge POP]] / [[GCP Edge Node]] as ingress
	- GCP is unique in how they handle front end coms

	- [[GCP Multi Region]]
-
- Compute Services
	- [[GCP Compute Engine]] (GCP VMs)
		- manage multiple instances with [[GCP Instance Group]]
		- add or remove capacity using autoscaling
	- GCP also offers [[GCP Live Migration]] for VM instances
		- for regular maintenance, it moves the complete instance to a different zone
		- can do this manually, but GCP does this
		- GPU attached instances cannot use this feature

- Storage Services
	- [[GCP Persistent Disk]] and [[GCP Local SSD]]
	- [[GCP Cloud Storage]]
	- [[GCP Filestore]]
	- Storage types refreshers
		- block storage
			- fastest available
			- files are split into evenly sized blocks of data with unique IDs
			- given to OS as raw data
			- OS structures it with a file system
			- mountable, bootable
		- file storage
			- Network File system
			- directory tree structure
			- Mountable (not bootable)
		- Object storage
			- unstructured
			- doesn't matter where it is
			- can use an open source tool to mount it called [[Fuse]]
			- but otherwise is unmountable and un-bootable
		- Performance terms

- Resource Hierarchy
  id:: 638b7b14-0709-448c-a97f-0ba4a44e5b5d
	- Permissions to resources inherit permissions similar to the structure of [[Azure AD]]
	- everything below the [[GCP Domain]] is considered a resource
	- Service-Level Resources
		- Compute Instances
		- [[GCP Cloud Storage]] buckets
		- [[GCP Cloud SQL]] databases
	- Account-level Resources
		- [[GCP Organization]]
		- [[GCP Folder]]
		- [[GCP Project]]
	- Above the [[GCP Organization]] is the [[GCP Domain]] (cloud level)
	- ![image](https://cloud.google.com/static/resource-manager/img/cloud-hierarchy.svg)
	- Resources are organized with a parent-child relationship
	- policies are controlled by [[GCP IAM]]
	- access control policies and configuration settings on a parent resource are inherited by the child
	- #+BEGIN_TIP
	  EACH CHILD RESOURCE CAN ONLY HAVE ONE PARENT
	  #+END_TIP
	- like [[Azure]], tags can be added to any resource or logical structure in GCP
	- mirror your resource hierarchy to your organization structure
