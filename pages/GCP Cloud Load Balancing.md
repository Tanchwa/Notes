- https load balancing
	- Distributes traffic across regions
	- handles closest instance routing across regions
	- failover HA
	- distributes traffic based on content type (layer 7)
- Network Load balancing
	- distribute traffic among server instances in the same region
	- based on IP protocol data
		- address
		- port
		- protocol
	- layer 3/4
- Three categories
	- global/ regional
		- | global | external HTTPS load balancing | SSL proxy load balancing | tcp proxy load balancing |
		  | regional | internal https load balancing | internal TCP/UDP load balancing | TCP/UDP network load balancing |
	- external/ internal
		- | external | external https load balancing | ssl proxy load balancing |  TCP/UDP network load balancing | TCP proxy load balancing |
		  | internal | internal HTTPS load balancing | | internal TCP/UDP load balancing | |
	- Traffic type
		- HTTPS
		- TCP
		- UDP
- How trafic is distributed is defined by "backend services" - [[GCP Managed Instance Group]] or [[GCP Network Endpoint Group]]
	- use health checks
	- session affinity
	- service timeout
	- traffic distribution
	- backends
