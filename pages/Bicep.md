- Azure specific infra as code tool
- domain specific language (DSL) to declaratively deploy to Azure resources
-
- file types
	- resource declaration - main.bicep
		- (not required, but is done to mimic [[Terraform]] style)
	- parameters - parameters.json
	- modules - SOMETHING.json
		- these are nested, callable files that can be called in main.bicep or other files
		- can cross reference files across repos by calling a different registry
	- bicepconfig.json
		- allow to declare custom set of inter rules when writing bicep files. conflicts will override default settings
		- can also use it to set up Bicep Repository?
- Key words
	- param - parameters, [[Terraform]] equivalent is var
	- var - variables SPECIFIC TO THE FILE
	- resource - start defining a resource, use the API call formatting to define the version of the resource
-
- can make symbolic references to things
	- for example, if you wanted the name of a SQL server, you would need
	- `sqlServer.name` but you can symbolically define that with
	- `output sqlServerName string = sqlServer.name`
-
- can reference higher level items with `parent` option
