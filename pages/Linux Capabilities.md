- can assign root privileges more granularly
- example: ping needs root privileges to access sockets, how do we do this?
	- in Ubuntu 18.xx it was given through setting the UID bit to root (the s in the user permissions), effectively forcing it to run as a specific user (root) no matter who ran it
	- in Centos 7, the set user ID bit is not set, but standard users can still access the command
- can see these with the `getcap` command
- in the ping example, the standard user is given the cap_net_raw permission
- can be set with the `setcap NAME_OF_CAP=p /bin/binary` p means program
