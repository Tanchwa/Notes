- overview
	- Know your limits of resources
	- know resource capabilities
	- know your costs
	- service integration
-
- A list of the different ((6357fec7-671e-4478-98ce-d8dd4ae52354)) can be found here
-
- Hard and soft limits
	- adjustable limits = soft
		- changing the service agreement
		- ex: kubernetes node limits default to 1000, but can go up to 5000
	- maximum limits = hard
		- ex: walls of a data center
		- can only have 4000 role assignments per subscription
	- limits are outlined in Microsoft documentation
	- FREE TRIALS CANNOT BE CHANGED
-
- Resource Capabilities
	- different SKUs have different feature sets (at different costs)
	- ex: API gateway  [[Azure API Management]] has 5 SKUs
		- Premium: does everything
		- Standard: no multiple custom domains
		- Basic: no AD integration
		- Developer: mix of basic/ standard
		- Free: limited
	- Ex: Load balancer
		- Gateway: can use 3rd party network virtual applications
		- Standard: has HTTPS, backend options: NIC or IP
		- Basic: no HTTPS, Backend only NIC
- Basically, need to be able to understand what the client's specific needs and uses are
-
- Resource integration
	- [[Azure vNet]] integration
		- allows you to deploy services directly into a vnet, makes these easier to connect to each other
	- Private endpoints
		- can network between vnets using endpoint IPs
	- Service endpoints
		- allows to you assign network stuff, IPs, whatever, to managed PaaS services
		- keeps all traffic within Microsoft
	- LATER take a look at how these work in the azure portal
-
- [[Azure Pricing Calculator]]
	- insight value add is to reduce cost significantly to be able to convince them to bring our teams on board
	- ALWAYS think cost when developing a solution
- Costs: Up versus out
