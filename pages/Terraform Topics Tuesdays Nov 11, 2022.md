- Session 3: Terraform CLI
- developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands
-
- if you're using multiple versions, you need to manage your path variables yourself
- init
	- inits working directory containing [[Terraform Configuration File]]s
	- prepares a working directory for other plans
	- `-upgrade` opt to upgrade modules and plugins as part of the init process
	- `-input=false` for when you don't want to pass in variables
	- `-from-module=MODULE_SOURCE` a type of initialization that copies a module source into an empty working directory, great for starting with an example config
	-
- validate
	- check weather the config is valid
- plan
	- syncs state with external resources, checks and makes sure its the same
	- notes differences between current state and desired state in the new edited file
	- `-refresh=false` bad option, disables drift detection
	- `-replace=ADDRESS` taints and destroys the specified resource
	- `-var='key' = 'value'` `--var-file=FILENAME`
	- creates a tfplan
	- can increase amount of concurrent resource creating API calls with `parallelism=n`
	- `-json` provides an output of the state file in json
- apply
	- `-refresh-only` only creates a new state file and root module output values
	-
- destroy
	- need to make sure you have a valid state file
-
-
-
- console
- format
	- helps take your code into [[HCL]] by giving you suggestions
	- can do `-dif` to see where its wrong
	- `-recursive`
	- most shops use this as a git hook before it even gets put into the repo see [here](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform)
- show
	- human readable output of the [[Terraform State File]]
	-
- state list
	- only list the resource addresses in the state file
- state show
	- show command will show the attributes of a single resource managed within the state file
-
- When working with a remote state file, how do we pass that into the path?
