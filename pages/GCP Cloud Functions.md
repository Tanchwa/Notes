- serverless functions as a service
- good for
	- data processing or ETL operations (video transcoding)
	- webhooks that respond to HTTP triggers
	- APIs
	- Mobile backend functions
- JavaScript, Python3, Go, Java
- Triggers
	- http
	- [[GCP Cloud Pub/Sub]]
	- [[GCP Cloud Storage]]
	- [[GCP Firestore]]
	- [[GCP Firebase]]
- pricing
	- uptime
	- resources provisioned
	- egress trafic may incur additional costs
	- no free tier
-
- HTTP Functions
	- respond to common http requests
	- automatically provision a TLS cert
- Background functions
	- handles events from GCP infrastructure
-
- Can only bind one trigger at a time
- Code stored in a [[GCP Cloud Storage]] bucket
-
- dataflow
	- requests go into Functions
	- assign to instances of your function
		- create new
		- or assign to existing
	- stateless
	- then passed off to VPC or internet
-
- functions should be written in idempotent way
	- https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-functions-pro-tips-building-idempotent-functions
	- In computer science, this refers to the notion ofÂ [idempotence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence), meaning that operation results remain unchanged when an operation is applied more than once. Likewise, a function is considered idempotent if an event results in the desired outcome even if the function is invoked multiple times for a given event.
