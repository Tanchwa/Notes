- a non human user account
- User-managed
	- you can create 100 by default or request quota increase
	- creates as service-account-name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- Default
	- some gcp services create roles that allow itself to access other resources
	- automatically granted the editor role
	- creates as default project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
	- or project-number-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com for compute engine
	- do not use these for for production workloads
- Google-managed

- Best practices
	- audit service account and keys using
		- `serviceAccount.keys.list()` method
		- or the Logs Viewer page in the console
	- only grant minimal permissions
	- one service account per service
	- take advantage of the IAM service account API to implement key rotation
