- Takeaways from module 1
	- did poorly
		- didn't take time to talk about what we're doing next
		- it was supposed to be a timeline of the entire project
		- if there is a live code base, use the LIVE IMAGES!
		- prebuild
	- did well
		- good job on the actual presentation
		- slide deck was KWISPY
	- For [[Azure Boards]] it is less important to know how to set up everything, but to be able to look at a board or a backstory and know how to split it into subtasks for timing
