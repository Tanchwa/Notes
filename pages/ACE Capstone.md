- Takeaways from module 1
	- did poorly
		- didn't take time to talk about what we're doing next
		- it was supposed to be a timeline of the entire project
		- if there is a live code base, use the LIVE IMAGES!
		- prebuild
	- did well
		- good job on the actual presentation
		- slide deck was KWISPY
	- For [[Azure Boards]] it is less important to know how to set up everything, but to be able to look at a board or a backstory and know how to split it into subtasks for timing
-
- 4 things answer every time
- Where did you start
	- Can be the
	  problem statement
	- “we started
	  to assess your top level billing and blah blah policies”
- Where are we now?
	- Includes what
	  have you done
- Where are we going?
	- Are we implementing
	  management group processes?
	- Just keep
	  doing what we’ve been doing?
- What problems do you have now or had getting there
-
- Should not really be show and tell
- Don't need to go over everything that we did
