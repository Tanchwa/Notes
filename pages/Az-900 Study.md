- #+BEGIN_TIP
  PUBLIC CLOUD IS ALSO CALLED CLOUD NATIVE
  #+END_TIP
- Private cloud is all on company's datacenters, also known as on prem

	- like [[Open Shift]] or [[Open Stack]]
- Hybrid
-
- Total Cost of Ownership
	- CapEX
		- Spending money UPFRONT on PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
			- deduct that expense from tax bill over time
			- Servers, storage, network, backup and archive, disaster recovery, datacenter, personal
			- you have to guess upfront what you plan to spend
		- license fees are obvious,
		- Unknowns are: Implimentation, Config, Training, Physical Security, hardware, it personal
		  maintenance
	- OpEx
		- the cost associated with an on-prem data center has shifted to the cost of the service provider, customer is only concerned with NON-PHYSICAL costs
			- leasing software and customization
			- training in cloud services
			- cloud support
			- compute & storage
			- **TRY WITHOUT INVESTING IN EQUIPMENT**
		- Subscription fees
		- unknowns are implementation, config, training
	- On average 75% savings when moving to the cloud
-
- Cloud Architecture Terminologies
	- HA - high availability
		- a few different machines can be split across multiple [[AZ]]s using a load balancer, azure's is called [[Azure Load Balancer]]
	- Scalability
		- ability to increase capacity based on demand
		- vertical scaling -  upgrade to bigger servers
		- horizontal - adding additional servers
	- Elasticity
		- can automatically increase or decrease based on demand
		- [[Azure VM Scale Set]], [[SQL Server Stretch Database]]
	- Fault Tolerance
	- Disaster Recovery - High Durability
		- do you have a backup?
		- how fast can you restore?
		- can you ensure current live data is not corrupt?
-
- Evolution of Compute
	- Dedicated
		- the machine is wholly utilized by a single customer
		- have control of the entire machine
	- VM's
		- can have multiple dedicated machines with specific compute compacity on one machine
		- run a guest OS on a hypervisor
	- Containers
		- can have multiple workloads running on a single machine/ VM that get their own resource pools
		- not limited by an OS
	- Functions
		- managed VM running managed containers
		- running single bits of code
		- also known as **SERVERLESS COMPUTE**
		- can suffer from cold starts, when you first launch the function, it has to provision the underlying server to start before your function runs
-
- Regions and Geographies
	- a [[Region]] is a group of multiple datacenters [[AZ]]
	- azure has 58 regions available across 140 countries
	- a [[Geography]] is a discrete market of two or more regions that preserves __data residency__ and __compliance boundaries__
		- United States
		- Azure Government (US)
		- Canada
		- Brazil
		- Mexico
	- its a guarantee that data will not lave boundaries
-
- Paired Regions
	- Each region is paired with one 300 miles away to ensure no outages
	- [[Azure Geo-redundant Storage]] replicates data to a secondary region automatically, ensuring data is durable even when the primary region isn't recoverable
	- For example: North America has East US paired with West US
-
- Region Types and Service Availability
	- Two Types of [[Region]]s
		- **Recommended region** - broadest range of resources & supports [[AZ]]
		- **Alternate region** - extends Azure's footprint within a data residency boundary where a recommended region also exists
		- labeled as "other" in the Azure portal
	- #+BEGIN_TIP
	  NOT ALL SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE IN EVERY REGION
	  #+END_TIP
	- Service Availability
		- General Availability - a service is considered ready to be used publicly by everyone
		- Three categories of availability otherwise -
			- **Foundational** - when it goes GA, it's available immediately or in 12 months in Recommended and Alternate Regions
			- **Mainstream** When GA, immediately available or in 12 in months in Recommended regions
			  may become available for Alternate regions based on demand
	- These have now changed
		- there's now
			- **General Availability**
			- **Private Preview**
			- **Public Preview**
-
- Special Regions
	- for compliance or legal reasons
	- US DoD central
	- US Gov Virginia
	- US Gov Iowa
	- *Three undisclosed US regions
	- China East and China North
		- maintained through a unique partnership with Microsoft and 21vianet 世紀互聯
-
- ((635707df-34da-4f81-b912-a01074387de8))
	- a physical location made up of one or more datacenter
	- a region generally has 3 availability zones
	- common practice to run workloads across 3 AZ's
-
- The following regions have at least 3 [[AZ]]s
	- Central US
	- East US 2
	- West US 2
	- West Europe
	- France Central
	- North Europe
	- Southeast Asia
-
- An [[AZ]] is a combo of [[Fault Domain]] and [[Update Domain]]
	- You use [[Availability Set]] to avoid these downtimes
