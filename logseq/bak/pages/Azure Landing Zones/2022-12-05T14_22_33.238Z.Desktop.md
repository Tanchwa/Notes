- [[Cloud Adoption Framework]] and its relation to landing zones
	- Microsoft designed strategy for not only technology, but also business models
	- everyone is going to be in one of the stages when we come to them
	- Define Strategy
		- Insight does strategy workshops
		- leverages Microsoft templates
	- Plan
		- Look at specifics, apps, data centers
		- What pieces need to be upscaled
		- also leverages Microsoft templates
	- Ready
		- This is where we start deploying sandbox env
		- initial deployments for landing zone blueprints
-
- Azure Landing Zones
	- help customers set up their Azure environment for scale, security, governance, networking
	- Landing zones are like foundations of a building
		- not all foundations are the same, (bridge, house, stadium)
	- We need to
		- Enable Migration
		- Consider all platform sources
		- Don't need to differentiate between IaaS or PaaS
-
- What's the value?
	- Aligned to business properties
	- cloud-design considerations
	- adapted for cloud operating model
		- cost consideration
		- tagging
		- different designs
	- ready for cloud applications
	- adaptable to grow to demand
		- also cloud can be iterated, changed, made better, just like code
-
- Challenges
	- Architecture complexity
	- Operating Compatibility
		- existing approaches to IT are sometimes not compatible with Azure platform
	- Lack of trust and desire for control
		- the lack of control, on the physical level for example, lead to miss-trust
		- hard to define who owns what within the cloud
